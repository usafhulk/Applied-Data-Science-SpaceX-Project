## Introduction

SpaceX has revolutionized the aerospace industry with its reusable rocket technology. This project aims to analyze SpaceX's launch data to derive insights, identify patterns, and predict outcomes using data science techniques.

Whether you're a data science enthusiast, a space exploration fan, or someone looking to learn data analysis and visualization, this project is for you.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following files and directories:

- **Notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks containing data analysis, visualizations, and machine learning models.
- **Data/**: Raw and processed datasets used in the project.
- **Images/**: Figures and visualizations generated during the analysis.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the project.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/usafhulk/Applied-Data-Science-SpaceX-Project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Applied-Data-Science-SpaceX-Project
   ```

3. Install the required libraries (it is recommended to use a virtual environment):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

*Note: If a `requirements.txt` file is not present, list the libraries used in the project here.*

## Usage
